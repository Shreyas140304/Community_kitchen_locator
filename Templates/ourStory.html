                <h2>How It All Began</h2>
                <p>
                    The <strong>Community Kitchen Locator</strong> began with one simple belief ‚Äî no one should go hungry.
                    During difficult times, we saw individuals and families struggle to find their next meal.
                    That‚Äôs when a small group of volunteers came together to build a digital platform
                    that connects people to nearby kitchens, food banks, and community meal centers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What started as a local initiative has now grown into a community-wide network powered by compassion and technology.
                    Every click, every volunteer, and every kitchen listed brings us one step closer to a hunger-free community.
